# Polygon Area Calculator
<br>
· The polygon area calculator has two python classes: Rectangle and Square, where Square inherits from Rectangle.<br>
<br>
· For both shapes, the user can set the height and width (which will be equal for the square), and can calculate for the area or perimeter.<br>
<br>
· Additionally, when the user inputs the dimension of one rectangle (square), they can find out how many rectangles(squares) of a smaller dimension can fit in the first. <br>
